## Is there a difference in  average years of education (EDUC) between the those who did or did not vote in 2012 (VOTE12)?

###Plot boxplots

```{r}
plot(EDUC~VOTE12,data=Ourdata)
```
  
  the people that didn't vote looks like they had a 5th grade education and the people that voted, it looks as if they had a 9th grade education.
  
  # Numerical results

```{r}
favstats(EDUC~VOTE12,data=Ourdata)
```

# Inferential  
  
```{r}
t.test(EDUC~VOTE12,data=Ourdata)
```

  The null hypothsis states there is no difference between the education of those who voted and those who didn't. The p value was a low number so I will reject the null hypothsis.
